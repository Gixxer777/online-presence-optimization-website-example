# Online Presence Optimization Website Example

## Description

This website was built to showcase my starting CSS and HTML skills. The starter code was updated to include more semantic HTML elements and the site was optimized for accessability. I learned that grouping multiple attributes together that are the same can clean up CSS stylesheets and make it nicer to look at and easier to work with.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the website, click on one of the top links (Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing) to go to their respective sections on the site. Also, to view the footer, press Command+Option+I (Mac) or CTRL+Shift+I (windows) or alternatively right click anywhere on the screen and go to Inspect. Go to footer and click the three dots to view the footer that is not displayed on the website.
